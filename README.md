The increasing prevalence of fake educational degrees poses a significant threat to academic integrity, employment credibility, and organizational trust. Fraudulent qualifications undermine the value of genuine education and can lead to unqualified individuals securing jobs, promotions, or academic positions. A Fake Degree Detection System leverages data mining techniques to analyze educational credentials, identify inconsistencies, and flag potentially fraudulent documents. By automating the verification process, this system helps institutions and employers detect fake degrees efficiently.
